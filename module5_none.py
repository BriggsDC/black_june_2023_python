#None is a very special value in Python; it is used to describe a null value or no value at all. None is NOT zero/0 and it is NOT False; it is NOT the same as an empty string. Only None can be None.
#x = None
  
#if x:
    #print("None is True")
#elif x is False:
    #print ("None is False")
#else:
    #print("None is not True, or False, None is just None") 
 
#You can assignd 'None' to a variable like on line 1  
x = None
if x is None:
    print('yes')
if x == None:
    print('it does')
