# The + and – sign are binary operators.
# Note that there are also unary + and – operators; they work w/ single operans of single values. You use the + or – sign before a single number to indicate whether or not the value is above or below 0
# 5 + 7 is the same as +12
# 5 - 7 is the same as -2; note that when you see the '-,' it is not optional
#print(+12)
#rint(-2)

# Order of Operators
# 1. **
# 2. * /. //  %
# 3. + -

# The preceision of float numbers in Python is limited
#print(0.1)
#print(0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1)

# Note that ‘ 2** 2’ is 2 to the power of 2. Python will always start from the RIGHT first!!
print(2 **2 ** 3)
