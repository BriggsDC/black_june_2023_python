#A function definition starts w/ 'def' for 'define'
def greet(): #After a space, enter the function's name. It is good practice to kepp all of your function definitions at the top of your file
    print('Hello, my dear!') #This is where the function body begins; the first function. Just like w/ 'if' statements and 'loops' you need at least 1 indented instruction that will be repeated everytime you invoke the instruction

greet() #You can repeat the invocation by typing multiple 'greet()'
