#Tuples is another type of collection; they are similar to lists. Tuples are a collection of multiples elements; all of the elements can have the same or different data types. 
#Lists are created w/ square [ ] brackets, but tuples use round ( ) brackets.
#This creates an 'empty tuple'
#empty_tuple = ()

#You have 2 options to create a 1 element tuple
#one_el_tuple_a = (1,)
#one_el_tuple_b = 1, #Here the round brackets are optional. Note a comma is used after each element; it is required due to syntax reasons. The ',' informs Python that you have a tuple and not just a single value

#When you have more than 1 value in your tuple, the final comma is optional
#three_el_tuple = 1, 2, 3 #Brackets can be omitted. Tuples prefer round brackets and lists prefer square brackets
#print(three_el_tuple)
